	            		We studied at Bandaranayake College from 1999 to 2007 as respectful students. After 8 years with ups and downs, we managed to unite again as one family under the warmth of Mother Bandaranayake.
        			</p>
        			<p class="lead left-align" >
						For nearly a decade we have been distant from each other. Finally the time has come to reunite and move forward. It's time to serve our Mother Bandaranayake as she served us when we needed it the most.
					</p>
        			<p class="lead left-align" >
						Nayakan's 2007 is not just a group of past students reconnecting. Nayakan's 07 stand for passion, friendship and brotherhood. To stand together and raise our Mother Bandaranayake higher and build our selfs as individuals.
					</p>
        			<p class="lead left-align" >
						So YOU!, As a brother of Nayakan's 07. Join us in this new adventure and be a part of something truly great.
